1) Folder /Example_DPPC contains the initial structure (in Gromacs format) as concentric spheres of a pure DPPC system of ~3,500 lipids and ~150,000 water molecules. Additionally, all files necessary for energy minimization, equilibration and production MD are included.

2) Folder /Spheres contains geometrically constructed concentric spheres of different size and composition.
   
3) Folder /Structures_10us contains structures of different size and composition after 10Âµs of unbiased molecular dynamics.
